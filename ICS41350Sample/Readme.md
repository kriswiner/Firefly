This is a .wav file of a sound snippet captured by the ICS41350 PDM microphone with the example sketch available in the Arduino IDE when the Firefly board variant is selected.  On Firefly, PDM CLK is D8 and PDM Data is D9. L/R select is connected do D6.
The snippet was captured at 16 kHz mono (single channel) via USB serial running at 115200 BAUD. I used Cool Term to capture the USB serial data to a file, then imported the file into Audacity as raw data- signed 16-bit PCM at 16 kHz -then selected the portion with actual voice sound and normalized using the default settings. Finally, I exported the resulting sound as a .wav file, playable by most pc audio utilities. This should give you some idea of the sound quality of human speech running at a fairly modest clock speed.
