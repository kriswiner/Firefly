Demonstrates a simple environmental sensor application reading battery voltage as well as
reading pressure, temperature and humidity from the BME280 and 
reading eCO2 and TVOC from the [CCS811](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/air-quality-sensors/) air quality sensor and updating the values through a battery service and environmental sensing service.

Still need to add air quality service...
